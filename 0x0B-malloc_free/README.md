#MALLOC & FREE FUNCTIONS
- Malloc is a function used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program. It will request a block of memory from the heap. If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.
- Free is a function that returns memory that had been initially requested by malloc back to the operating system if its not needed anymore.
